<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1.5 cups white sugar</li>
    <li>1 cup softened butter</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>2.75 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons cream of tartar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>0.25 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>Coating</li>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons with white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    
</ul>
<h3>Step-By-Step Directions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). 
        Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease.</li>
    <li>Make cookies: Beat together white sugar, butter, and eggs in a 
        large bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. 
        Combine flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt in a 
        separate bowl; stir into creamed butter mixture until dough holds 
        together.</li>
    <li>Mix together white sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl until well combined.</li>
    <li>Form dough into balls (about 2 teaspoons in each ball), then roll in cinnamon-sugar 
        coating. Place dough balls about 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven on the center rack for 7 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on 
        the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
</ol>
