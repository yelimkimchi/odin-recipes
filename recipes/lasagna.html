<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lasagna is a filling, hearty dish of lasagna noodles, meat sauce, and cheese
    repeatedly layered on top of each other. It is great straight out of the oven, 
    but a microwaved lasagna also never fails!
</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Meat: sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef</li>
    <li>Onion and garlic: an onion and two cloves of garlic</li>
    <li>Tomato products: crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, two cans of tomato paste</li>
    <li>Sugar: two tablespoons of white sugar</li>
    <li>Spices and seasonings: fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, 
        fennel seeds, and black pepper</li>
    <li>Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, ricotta</li>
    <li>Egg: an egg</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step-By-Step Directions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
    <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
    <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons 
        parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for 
        about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 
        8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles 
        lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella 
        cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
    <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, 
        either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
    <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
